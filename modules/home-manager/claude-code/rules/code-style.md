# Code Style Guidelines

## General Principles

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow language-specific conventions and idioms
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use meaningful variable and function names

## Formatting

- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces for Nix, 4 spaces for Python)
- Keep lines under 100 characters when possible
- Use blank lines to separate logical sections

## Comments

- Write comments that explain "why" not "what"
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Use docstrings for public APIs
